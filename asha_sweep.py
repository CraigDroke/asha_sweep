        Parameters:
            bracket (dict): A dictionary representing the state of a bracket. It should include:
                - "rungs" (dict): Keys are rung indices, and values contain rung-specific metadata.
                - "configs" (dict): Keys are configuration names, and values include details 
                about each configuration's progress.

        Returns:
            tuple:
                - str: The name of the configuration selected for execution.
                - int: The rung index of the selected configuration.

        Behavior:
            - The method first checks for promotable configurations in higher rungs based on fitness scores.
            - If no promotable configuration is found, it checks for new configurations in the current rung.
            - If no configurations are available, the method waits for 30 seconds and retries.

        Notes:
            - A configuration is promotable if it has enough fitness scores to meet the requirements of the current rung.
            - The method avoids selecting configurations that are already running.
            - Configurations are selected based on their fitness scores, ensuring the top-performing ones are prioritized.
            - If no valid configuration is found, the method waits before retrying.

        Raises:
            SystemExit: If an unexpected error occurs, the method may lead to indefinite waiting.

            bracket = {

        Executes the Hyperband optimization process across all defined brackets.

        This method iterates through each bracket, managing the allocation of resources 
        to configurations and tracking progress across rungs. Configurations are evaluated 
        based on their fitness scores, and the best configuration is determined once the 
        stopping criteria are met.

        Workflow:
            1. Display the total number of brackets and resources allocated per rung.
            2. Initialize progress bars to track the percentage of configurations evaluated 
            in each rung.
            3. Allocate available GPUs to configurations and start jobs for evaluation.
            4. Update progress bars after each evaluation.
            5. Check stopping criteria to determine when to end the process for a bracket.
            6. Identify and display the best configuration once all brackets are complete.

        Attributes Used:
            - self.brackets (dict): The dictionary containing bracket information, including rungs, 
            configurations, and their parameters.
            - self.save_path (str): Path where fitness scores and other job information are saved.
            - self.time_between_runs (int): Time to wait between job submissions.

        Methods Invoked:
            - self.get_available_gpus(): Retrieves a list of available GPU indices.
            - self.get_job(bracket): Fetches the next configuration and rung to evaluate.
            - self.start_job(bracket_num, config_name, config_params, resources_to_add, gpu_number): 
            Starts the evaluation of a configuration.
            - get_fitness_scores(save_path, config_name): Retrieves fitness scores for a given configuration.
            - get_current_runs(save_path): Returns the list of currently running jobs.
            - hyperband.get_best_configuration(): Determines the best configuration based on fitness scores.

        Stopping Criteria:
            - The process ends for a bracket once at least one configuration has been fully evaluated 
            (all rungs completed).

        Notes:
            - Progress bars track the percentage of configurations evaluated in each rung.
            - Configurations are selected dynamically based on availability of resources and fitness scores.
            - The method ensures the best configuration is determined only after all runs are complete.
